<h2>Anne Lauscher</h2>
<p><b>Professor, University of Hamburg, Germany</b></p>
<a href="https://anne-lauscher.de/">Website</a><br/>

Anne Lauscher (Ààan…ô Ààla äÃØ É…ê, she/her) is Associate Professor of Data Science at the University of Hamburg, where her research group investigates Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems with a focus on fair, inclusive, and sustainable communication.
Before, she was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Natural Language Processing group at Bocconi University (Milan, Italy) where she was working on introducing demographic factors into language processing systems with the aim of improving algorithmic performance and system fairness. She obtained her Ph.D. from the Data and Web Science group at the University of Mannheim (Germany), where her research focused on the interplay between language representations and computational argumentation. During her studies, she conducted research internships at and became an independent research contractor for Grammarly Inc. (New York City, U.S.) and for the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Seattle, U.S.). Her research gets regularly published at international top-tier Natural Language Processing (e.g., ACL, EMNLP, etc.) and Artificial Intelligence (e.g., AAAI) venues and has been recognized with multiple awards. In 2022, she was nominated for the Dissertation Award of the German Informatics Society and named as one of the "100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics for 2023".
